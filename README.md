# This repo was created so that I can develop side projects.

# Folders and files
  
For better organization, I decided that it would be better to categorize everything into separate child directories. Scripts, source codes and shell scripts must be separated into different directories.

### NAME

### DESCRIPTION
[urlisup.sh](https://github.com/luismacena19/MyProjects/blob/master/Scripts/urlisup.sh) is a simple script made to test if a site is down or not. The script uses [ping](https://man.archlinux.org/man/ping.8) command in order to find out if the site is up or down.
